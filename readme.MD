extend the Music Library code that we began developing in class. Please refer to the video and slides for details on how to accomplish each task.

The lab will be graded according to the specifications grading method described in the syllabus. Specifically:

A completed, on-time lab is worth 2 points.

A lab that is late or incomplete is worth 1 point.

A lab that is missing is worth 0 points.

Task 1: Modify the classes to use the interface on the "Class Diagram, pt 2" slide.

Task 2. Add a class variable called entityCounter to the Entity class, and use it to give each Entity a unique ID. Create EntityTest to make sure this works.

Task 3: Extend the Entity constructor to use the Date class, and extend EntityTest appropriately.

Task 4: Create a SongTester, and use it to print the name, date, and entityID for Songs.

Task 5: Implement SongInterval, extend Song to use this, and create SongTest.

Task 6: Implement equals() for Artist, Album, Song and Entity. Extend your test suite.

Task 7: Create a Library, with addSong() and findSong, and implement LibraryTest.

Task 8: Add genre as an instance variable for Song.

Task 9: add toString(), toHTML(), toXML() to Artist, Entity, Song, and Album()

Task 10: implement the Playlist class, along with a tester.

Task 11: Add 'liked' to the Song class, and getLiked() to the Library.

Task 12: Create an updated class diagram that includes all the classes, their isA and hasA relationships, and their publically available interfaces. (no need to include instance variables.) Add this to your repo.
